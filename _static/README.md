# Connect UI - Vue.js Application

This directory contains the Vue.js-based connection UI that handles app connections through Pipedream.

## Files

- `connect.html` - Main Vue.js application for handling app connections

## Features

- **Modern UI Design**: Clean, responsive interface with Pipedream branding
- **Dynamic App Detection**: Automatically detects the app from URL parameters
- **Token Validation**: Validates connection tokens from the URL
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during connection processes

## Usage

The connect UI is accessible at:

```
http://localhost:3000/_static/connect.html?token={token}&app={app_name}
```

### URL Parameters

- `token` (required): Connection token generated by the backend
- `app` (required): Name of the app to connect (e.g., "serpapi", "slack")

### Example URLs

- SerpAPI connection: `http://localhost:3000/_static/connect.html?token=ctok_498678482e3848d39619cab2&app=serpapi`
- Slack connection: `http://localhost:3000/_static/connect.html?token=ctok_123456789&app=slack`

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Vue.js 3 (CDN version)
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API calls
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern design patterns
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support

## Customization

### App-Specific Information

You can customize the app information by modifying the `loadAppInfo()` method in the Vue component. Currently, it shows placeholder data, but you can extend it to:

- Fetch app details from your API
- Show app-specific connection instructions
- Display app logos or branding

### Styling

The UI uses a clean, modern design that matches Pipedream's branding. You can customize:

- Colors and themes
- Layout and spacing
- Typography
- Animations and transitions

### Connection Flow

The current implementation includes a placeholder connection flow. You can extend it to:

- Implement actual OAuth flows
- Add multi-step connection processes
- Handle different authentication methods
- Integrate with your backend APIs

## Development

To modify the UI:

1. Edit `connect.html`
2. Refresh the page in your browser
3. Test with different app parameters

## Dependencies

- Vue.js 3 (loaded from CDN)
- Axios (loaded from CDN)

No build process required - this is a single HTML file that can be served directly.
